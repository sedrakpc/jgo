The JGo Project aims to provide a complete compiler and runtime environment for the Go programming language to/on the Java Virtual Machine. The jgoc compiler is written in Scala and the runtime in Java.

(Note: This project is on indefinite hiatus and has not been worked on in several years. I've stopped work on JGo for three reasons: first, I felt as though I had learned almost all of what I set out to learn when I started (this was originally an independent study project for my senior year of high school); second, the remaining work mostly would have involved extraordinary contortions to map Go's freewheeling constructions (e.g., interfaces) onto the rigid JVM; and third, there was only moderate interest in a JVM implementation of Go. It's possible that one or both of the latter two points have changed in the past few years. I'm still around, so if you're strongly interested in this project or related things, feel free to contact me, though I cannot guarantee I will be able to commit resources. The rest of this page has been left as it was before I decided to suspend work.)
